MY FAVORITE MEXICAN CASSEROLE
*Chris Gavenda, Wildwood, MO
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F, grease a 13x9-inch baking dish, and scatter evenly on the bottom of the pan:
    1 1/2 c tortilla chips, crushed
Combine and put half in the pan:
    1 lb cooked chicken, shredded
    15 1/2 oz can garbanzo beans, drained
    15 1/2 oz can kidney beans, drained
    15 1/4 oz can corn kernels, drained
    8 oz can tomato sauce
    1 c prepared salsa
    1 c red onion, diced
    1 c green pepper, 1/4" diced
    1/4 c cilantro, chopped
    1 T garlic, minced
    Salt and pepper, to taste
Sprinkle half over the combined mixture in the pan:
    6 oz Monterey Jack cheese, grated
    6 oz Sharp Cheddar cheese, grated
Top with the other half of the mixture, then sprinkle the rest of the cheese over that. Bake for 30 minutes and let stand for 5 minutes before serving. Serve in bowls so others can garnish as desired:
    2 c tomatoes, diced
    1 c sour cream
    1/2 c cilantro
